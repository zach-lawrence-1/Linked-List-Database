# Linked List Database
## Description
This is a simple database that tracks basic information about employees at different companies using linked lists to store that data. 
The entries are also stored in a sorted order using an operator overload of < during the insertion of an element.

I wanted to add more functionality like storing the database in files as well as the linked list names that were 
associated with said files. At the time however I realized that I cannot make objects defined as a name from a string.
I then decided to stop the project here just to show myself how much more I have learned which was the main goal
of the project. Looking back at this project, I could have simply stored the linked lists in a special format and rebuild them
from the file it was stored in.
